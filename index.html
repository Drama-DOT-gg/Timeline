      <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">5 July 2020</p>
      <p class="text-muted">
        On the 5th of July, Summerhoax made the decision to permanently close its website, resulting in the removal of all threads and content from their platform. This action was taken amidst an overall toxic atmosphere within the community, prompting the shutdown.      </p>

        <p class="text-muted">
          Winterhoax started on July 7th. It was like a new version of Summerhoax, where people were warned about summer hoaxes. The first topic on Winterhoax was about Fabithost. AYS and Michael (known as Dziaoid) ran Winterhoax.

        <h5 class="fw-bold">FalixNodes thread emerges</h5>
        <p class="text-muted mb-2 fw-bold">7 August 2020</p>
        <p class="text-muted">
          On August 7th, Justin started the conversation about FalixNodes. FalixNodes, managed by Nike Zalans, also known as ItzAwesome, provided free hosting services. However, within the Summerhoax community, FalixNodes had a reputation for engaging in questionable practices. They offered free hosting but had experienced data losses in the past and were associated with raids on other hosting services. Their notoriety stemmed from exploiting companies like Hetzner, Arc.io, and others for obtaining free servers or generating money. The FalixNodes thread got a lot of attention to Drama.gg and really got the community active.
